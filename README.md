# Backend Code & Dataset
The code for the backend and the dataset were gotten from Kishan's Youtube tutorial,found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_78fGgQMjM, which walked through how to implement things in the code. This attached link is for the original work,https://github.com/kishan0725/AJAX-Movie-Recommendation-System-with-Sentiment-Analysis, which has most of the machine learning skills which we needed to implement this system. We reused his code as we did not have the adequate skills in machine learning.
